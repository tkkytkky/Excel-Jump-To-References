## How to Use
- This is a VBA script that lists and allows you to jump to a selected cell when the currently selected cell in Excel has multiple references.
- You can use it by importing `import/JumpForm.frm` and `import/JumpForm.frx` as forms, and `import/JumpModule.bas` as a module.
- If you register it in your personal macro workbook, it can be used in any Excel file.
- Since the macro can be assigned a shortcut key, please set it by going to `Alt + F8` â‡’ `Option` (e.g., `Ctrl + Shift + J`).
